# Fetch data from external API and render it in the app


### What the project does?
This is an exercise of building an app which will fetch data from an external source using a public API and render retrieved data in the app.
For my case I chose News API service which allows search through the latest news on the web.
The app allows to specify the searching criteria and runs the search via API and then renders the retrieved data in the Bootstrap cards as well
as paginating all records (6 per page)

### Installation/How to run
Clone the project, run the local web-server, open index.html


### Roadmap of future improvements
It's a required exercise and part of the course and I will continue development of this project as/if necessary.
